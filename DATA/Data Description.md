## Data Description
There are two datasets in this folder, AMCstocks.csv and AMCdataFinal.csv. AMCstocks.csv is the comma seperated value file we downloaded directly from NASDAQ [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc/historical). AMCdataFinal.csv fixes the datatypes for each field and is the dataset used for our ARIMA modeling.
